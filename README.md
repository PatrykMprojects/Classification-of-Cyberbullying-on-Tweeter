The project focused on developing ensemble models for NLP classification problem.  
In this project, the development of machine learning ensemble models was undertaken in several stages, including data collection from a Kaggle dataset with labeled cyberbullying classes, 
data preprocessing involving emoji removal, stemming, and lemmatization, dataset splitting using both "train-test split" and various cross-validation methods, 
and feature extraction through Bag of Words (BoW) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) techniques. 
Experiments were conducted on two voting classifiers, with one combining seven models and the other replacing three ensemble methods with a Random Forest. 
Evaluation criteria included accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for model performance, alongside feature extraction and cross-validation assessments. 
These comprehensive evaluation metrics ensured a thorough evaluation of the models, despite the dataset's balanced nature.
